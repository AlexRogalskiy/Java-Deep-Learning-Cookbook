Although there are multiple ways to perform a single task, here are few of the commonly used network architectures:

| Problem  | Core Architecture |
|--|--|
| Binary Classification | MLP |
| Image Classification | CNN |
| Anomaly Detection | Autoencoder |
| Time Series classification | RNN


Note that, the optimal architectural decision can vary upon the type of data dealt with and whether it is supervised/unsupervised.
