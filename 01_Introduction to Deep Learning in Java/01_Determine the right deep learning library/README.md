 - JVM has its own advantage when it comes to enterprise application development. Deep learning models created using DL4J is cross-platform compatible.
 - Production deployment is as simple as running the maven build from Jenkins job or SSH terminal. 
 - DL4J also offer dedicated support along with an enterprise deep learning suite called SKIL.
 - Import Keras/Tensorflow models without having to worry about the integration.
 - Existence of strong ETL component (DataVec) as equivalent to pandas.
 - Existence of strong scientific computing environment (ND4J) as equivalent to numpy. 
 - Make deep learning reachable to a vast community of Java developers.
